## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a beverage enthusiast, I want to conduct structured tasting sessions in different formats (quick personal, study mode for learning, competition mode for group evaluation) so that I can explore and evaluate beverages systematically with appropriate tools for each context.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Quick Tasting - Personal Session
1. **Given** a user wants to quickly taste multiple beverages, **When** they select a beverage type and provide a session name, **Then** they can add beverages one-by-one with structured evaluation fields and end the session when complete.

2. **Given** a user is in a Quick Tasting session, **When** they evaluate a beverage with name, photo, aroma notes, flavor notes, overall score, and additional notes, **Then** the system captures all evaluation data and allows adding more items or ending the session.

#### Study Mode - Pre-defined Items Approach
1. **Given** a host wants to conduct a structured study tasting, **When** they choose "Pre-defined Items" mode and enter all items upfront, **Then** participants can join and evaluate only the pre-defined items.

2. **Given** a Pre-defined Study Mode session is created, **When** the host wants to participate as a taster, **Then** they can join as both host and participant with full tasting capabilities.

#### Study Mode - Collaborative Approach
1. **Given** a host wants an interactive study experience, **When** they choose "Collaborative" mode, **Then** both host and participants can add items during the tasting process.

2. **Given** a Collaborative Study Mode session is active, **When** participants suggest items, **Then** the host can approve/reject suggestions before they become available for evaluation.

3. **Given** a host is moderating a Collaborative session, **When** they want to participate as a taster, **Then** they can evaluate items alongside participants while maintaining moderator controls.

#### Competition Mode - Group Evaluation
1. **Given** a user wants to host a competitive tasting, **When** they create a Competition Mode session with all items and correct answers preloaded, **Then** participants can join and be evaluated against the correct answers with optional ranking.

2. **Given** a Competition Mode session is active, **When** the host monitors participant progress and manages the session, **Then** they can view live rankings, end the session for all participants, and export results.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to add more than 10 categories to a tasting session?
- How does the system handle participants joining a competition after it has started?
- What happens when a host ends a competition session while participants are still tasting?
- How does the system validate sliding scale rankings when multiple participants provide scores?
- What happens when a competition has no correct answers defined for required categories?
- What happens when a host leaves a Collaborative Study Mode session they started?
- How does the system handle item suggestions in Collaborative mode if the host becomes unresponsive?
- What happens if participants join a Collaborative session after items have already been added and approved?
- How does the host's dual role (moderator + participant) affect the tasting flow and UI?
- What happens when a host wants to switch from Collaborative to Pre-defined mode mid-session?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
