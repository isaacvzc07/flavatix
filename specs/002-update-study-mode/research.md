# Research Findings: Update Study Mode Specification

**Date**: September 22, 2025
**Feature**: Update Study Mode Specification
**Status**: Complete - Leveraging existing system architecture

## Research Summary

This feature enhancement builds upon the existing FlavorWheel Study Mode implementation. The Technical Context is fully defined based on the established Next.js + Supabase architecture, requiring no additional research for technology choices.

### Architecture Leverage

**Existing System Components**:
- **Decision**: Utilize existing `create-tasting.tsx` page with enhanced Study Mode selection
- **Rationale**: Current page already supports mode selection, needs only approach selector addition
- **Alternatives considered**: Separate Study Mode creation page (rejected due to UI complexity)

**Database Extensions**:
- **Decision**: Extend existing `tasting_participants` table with role management
- **Rationale**: Table already exists for Competition mode, adding role fields maintains consistency
- **Alternatives considered**: Separate role management table (rejected due to unnecessary complexity)

**Real-time Collaboration**:
- **Decision**: Use Supabase real-time subscriptions for live suggestion updates
- **Rationale**: Already integrated for other features, provides instant UI updates
- **Alternatives considered**: WebSocket implementation (rejected due to existing Supabase investment)

### Role Management Architecture

**Dual Role Pattern**:
- **Decision**: Support 'host', 'participant', and 'both' roles in single table
- **Rationale**: Allows hosts to participate while maintaining moderator privileges
- **Implementation**: Role-based permission flags (`can_moderate`, `can_add_items`)

**Permission Separation**:
- **Decision**: Clear separation between tasting actions and moderator controls
- **Rationale**: Prevents UI confusion and maintains security boundaries
- **Implementation**: Component-level permission checks based on role

### Collaborative Workflow Design

**Suggestion Lifecycle**:
- **Decision**: Three-state suggestion flow: pending → approved/rejected
- **Rationale**: Clear workflow states prevent ambiguity in collaborative sessions
- **Implementation**: Status field with automated transitions

**Host Responsiveness Handling**:
- **Decision**: Allow session continuation with read-only access if host becomes unresponsive
- **Rationale**: Ensures participant experience isn't blocked by host availability
- **Implementation**: Graceful degradation with moderator reassignment capability

### UI/UX Considerations

**Mode Selection Clarity**:
- **Decision**: Radio buttons with descriptive text for Pre-defined vs Collaborative
- **Rationale**: Clear differentiation helps users choose appropriate workflow
- **Implementation**: Contextual help text for each option

**Role Indicators**:
- **Decision**: Visual badges showing current user role in session
- **Rationale**: Prevents confusion about capabilities and permissions
- **Implementation**: Color-coded indicators with tooltips

### Performance Optimizations

**Real-time Subscription Management**:
- **Decision**: Targeted subscriptions for suggestion updates only
- **Rationale**: Minimizes bandwidth and prevents UI spam
- **Implementation**: Filtered queries based on user permissions

**Batch Operations**:
- **Decision**: Support bulk approval/rejection of suggestions
- **Rationale**: Improves efficiency for hosts managing multiple suggestions
- **Implementation**: Multi-select interface with batch actions

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1 Priority (Foundation)
1. Database schema updates (role fields, suggestions table)
2. Basic API endpoints for suggestions and moderation
3. Role management utilities and permission checks

### Phase 2 Priority (Core Features)
1. Study Mode approach selector in create-tasting page
2. Suggestion submission interface for Collaborative mode
3. Host moderation dashboard for pending suggestions

### Phase 3 Priority (Polish)
1. Real-time updates for collaborative workflows
2. Role-based UI adaptations
3. Error handling and edge cases

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- Database schema additions (follows existing patterns)
- Basic API endpoints (standard CRUD operations)
- UI component additions (leverages existing component library)

### Medium Risk Items
- Real-time collaborative features (requires careful subscription management)
- Role-based permission system (complex state management)
- Host responsiveness handling (edge case complexity)

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Testing**: Test collaborative features with small user groups first
- **Fallback UI**: Ensure degraded experience when real-time fails
- **Permission Validation**: Server-side checks prevent unauthorized actions
- **Session Recovery**: Automatic role reassignment for abandoned sessions

## Success Criteria Validation

**Technical Feasibility**:
- ✅ Database extensions compatible with existing schema
- ✅ API patterns consistent with current implementation
- ✅ UI components buildable with existing libraries
- ✅ Real-time features supported by Supabase architecture

**User Experience**:
- ✅ Clear differentiation between Study Mode approaches
- ✅ Intuitive role management and permissions
- ✅ Responsive collaborative workflows
- ✅ Graceful error handling for edge cases

## Technology Integration

**Supabase Extensions**:
- Real-time subscriptions for live suggestion updates
- Row Level Security for role-based data access
- Database functions for bulk operations

**Next.js Integration**:
- API routes for suggestion management
- Client-side state management for role permissions
- Responsive components for collaborative interfaces

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for role permission logic
- Integration tests for collaborative workflows
- E2E tests for complete user journeys

**Research Status**: COMPLETE - All technical approaches validated against existing system capabilities
