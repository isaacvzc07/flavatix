# Feature Specification: Update Study Mode Specification

**Feature Branch**: `002-update-study-mode`
**Created**: September 22, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Update Study Mode specification to support both pre-defined items and dynamic addition, with proper host/participant role management and host participation capability"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Analyzed Study Mode role complexity and host participation needs
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: Pre-defined vs Dynamic item modes, Host/Participant roles, Dual participation capability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements clearly specified in detailed input
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows for both Study Mode approaches
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Study session management, role-based permissions, collaborative workflows
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No uncertainties found, all requirements clear
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a tasting host, I want flexible Study Mode options that allow me to either pre-plan all items or collaborate dynamically with participants, while still being able to participate as a taster myself, so that I can adapt the tasting experience to different group dynamics and preparation levels.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Study Mode - Pre-defined Items Approach
1. **Given** a host wants to conduct a structured study tasting, **When** they choose "Pre-defined Items" mode, **Then** they can enter all items and categories upfront before inviting participants.

2. **Given** a Study Mode session with pre-defined items is created, **When** participants join, **Then** they can only evaluate the pre-defined items and cannot add new ones.

3. **Given** a host has set up a pre-defined Study Mode session, **When** they want to participate as a taster, **Then** they can join as both host and participant with full tasting capabilities.

#### Study Mode - Collaborative Approach
1. **Given** a host wants a more interactive study experience, **When** they choose "Collaborative" mode, **Then** both host and participants can add items during the tasting process.

2. **Given** a Collaborative Study Mode session is active, **When** the host adds an item, **Then** it appears for all participants to evaluate, and participants can also suggest items.

3. **Given** a Collaborative Study Mode session is ongoing, **When** a participant suggests an item, **Then** the host can approve/reject the suggestion before it becomes available for evaluation.

4. **Given** a host is moderating a Collaborative session, **When** they want to participate as a taster, **Then** they can evaluate items alongside participants while maintaining moderator controls.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a host leaves a Collaborative session they started?
- How does the system handle item suggestions in Collaborative mode if the host becomes unresponsive?
- What happens if participants join a Collaborative session after items have already been added?
- How does the host's dual role (moderator + participant) affect the tasting flow?
- What happens when a host wants to switch from Collaborative to Pre-defined mode mid-session?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide two Study Mode approaches: Pre-defined Items and Collaborative
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow hosts to choose between Pre-defined and Collaborative modes when creating Study sessions
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable Pre-defined mode hosts to enter all items and categories before participants join
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent participants from adding items in Pre-defined Study Mode
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow both hosts and participants to add items in Collaborative Study Mode
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide hosts moderator controls to approve/reject participant item suggestions in Collaborative mode
- **FR-007**: System MUST enable hosts to participate as tasters in both Study Mode approaches while maintaining moderator privileges
- **FR-008**: System MUST clearly indicate when a user has dual host/participant roles in Study sessions
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain item consistency across all participants in Collaborative mode once items are approved
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle host departure gracefully in Collaborative mode by either transferring moderation or ending the session
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent role confusion by clearly separating host controls from tasting actions
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow hosts to switch between participating in tasting and moderating the session seamlessly

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Study Session**: Tasting session with mode type and host/participant management
- **Session Participant**: User with role (host or participant) and tasting capabilities
- **Item Suggestion**: Proposed item in Collaborative mode with approval status
- **Role Assignment**: Dual role management for hosts who also participate
